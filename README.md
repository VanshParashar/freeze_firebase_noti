# firebse_freeze_app

In this project i am sending push notifications using firebase Console 
.I send data in form of key and value pairs
key is "type" and value will be "stop" and "start". Whenever I send "start" my custom ringtone started and if I tap on the notification my mobile screen is freeze 
I did not found any alternative or any way to open my app without on tap of notification
and whenever I send "stop" my custom ringtone stops and now my mobile screen is backable
